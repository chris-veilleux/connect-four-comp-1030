# connect-four-comp-1030
Console based recreation of Connect Four in Java.

This is my final project for my Programming Fundamentals course, using Java.
It is a two-player, console based recreation of Connect Four with the option for each player to wager a bet.
In this project, I implemented all of my knowledge to date of both Object-Oriented Programming concepts,
as well as general programming techniques.
The source code (.java) files can be found in the src directory of this repository,
or the executable JAR file is available as well.
